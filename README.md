This project is created at the London Hackathon.
Objectives
1. To enable women to be better paid and to reduce or eliminate fraud.

The UN Women's Cash for Work Programme is a well documented success story. It enables women to scan their iris and then use this as a key identifier to collect monies from local shops.

We intend in this project to add value by allowing for anti-fraud systems to be added. This will restrict payments on a GPS basis.

Also the decentralised nature of this data recording may then be used to build a decentralised credit rating for people on low incomes and working in Africa. This is a critical step to building more of an infrastructure.
